# Song Player in Visual C# and WPF
A nice sample of how to read, play, and analyze audio files in C# and WPF

# Time to get rid of Window Media Player... maybe
This is a simple audio player that allows you to load a file and then it plays and analyze the progression of the track

This is a great example for anyone trying to get up and running with binary I/O as the code is all commented and allows for a jump start feel of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)

#For people who are new to Visual Studios
- Just clone, download, or even for this repository and open the SongReader.sln file
- Once VS opens up find the "solution explorer" and open the MainWindow.xaml and the MainWindow.xaml.cs file inside it
- this is the markup of the buttons and other UI and the code
- press F5 or the run/start button in the top toolbar to enter debug mode
- build the solution if you want this beautiful piece of software on your desktop
